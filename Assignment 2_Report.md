## Question 1

The Option-to-volume has a certain power for prediction of future returns on short run. Because of the existence of short-sale constrains, negative news is much harder to reflect on the price than good news in equity market. While option market has no such constrains, investors with bad news tends to capture this opportunity by trading more frequently in option market. Therefore, a higher option-to-volume will indicate worse future condition of such stock, or a lower future return. 

However, if option leverage is high, the bid-ask spreads in option market increases, similar to high short-sale costs in equity market, reducing the trading in option market. Under this situation, the prediction power of option-to-volume is weaker.

## Question 2

### a. 

We will discuss in 3 parts, trading cost, leverage and risk management.

- **Trading cost:** short sale may face lots of constrains, which may cause high trading cost or even unable to short. In this case, option market will provide a good alternative with low cost. However, if bid-ask spreads in option market increase to exceed cost of short sale, investors may choose equity market.

- **Leverage:** short sale in equity market will face borrow constrains. Investors who are confident with negative information have much limited profit possibility. While in option market, the leverage could be very high and can gain more if the price goes in right way.

- **Risk:** However, the high leverage in option market will also lead to high risk. The volatility in option market is also much higher than equity market. Thus, investors who seek stability may choose to short in equity market instead of in option market.

### b.

D’Avolio<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> finds that the degree of institutional ownership explains 55% of cross-sectional variation in loan supply and is its most important determinant. Institutional ownership is the main provider of lendable supply of securities, thus if institutional ownership is low, the lendable supple tends to be low and short-sale constrains would be higher for such stocks.

Large passive index funds, insurance companies, and pension funds are the most active lenders<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>, and most of their position is in big stocks. Therefore, fewer institution investors will cover small stocks, leading to a smaller institutional ownership and a larger short-sale constraints.

### c.

Equal-weighted portfolio will have better return. Because high-value stock on the one has more active institutional coverage and thus higher lendable supply for securities, the short sale constrains is much lower. On the other hand, information disclosure for high-value stock is more efficient than that for small companies. It’s less likely to be overpriced. Thus, this strategy is weak for high-value stocks.

Therefore, if the portfolio is value-weighted, high-value stocks will have larger position and less return than equal-weighted portfolio.
